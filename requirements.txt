### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| File is named `requirement.txt` (missing "s") | Rename to `requirements.txt` |
| File is inside a subfolder | Move it to the **root of the repo** |
| File is empty | Paste the correct contents: `streamlit` and `feedparser` |
| File has hidden `.txt.txt` extension | On Windows, ensure it's not `requirements.txt.txt` by checking file type |

### ✅ You Should Now See the Dashboard Working

Let me know if you’d like me to:
- Verify your GitHub repo setup (you can share the repo link)
- Add fallback messages if feeds are empty
- Style the dashboard or add a “Saved Articles” section

Would you like me to check your repo and confirm the file setup is correct?
